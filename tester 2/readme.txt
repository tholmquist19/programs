Attached are two files for quickly testing submissions for prog3 in a condensed and straightforward manner.

output.npz contains the expected results for the Z-Transformations as written in the README.md file provided for the assignment.

tester.py runs your code, and tests the functionality of both your PLA and Z-Transformation code; however, please note that the means of grading your submissions will be modified.

How to run tester.py:
1. Place the files in the same folder as the tester.

2. Run tester.py

The output is verbose, so you will know if the run succeeded or if your code is stuck in a loop.
On a low end machine, the entire run should take no longer than 30 seconds to complete.

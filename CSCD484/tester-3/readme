Make sure to place the tester.py and both npz files in the same directory as the 'code_logistic_regression' and 'code_misc' folders

Please note, that I got the results from making the model's input deterministic rather than random:

1. 0 initialization of the weights.
2. The input data was not shuffled.

If you are getting errors due to shuffling the data, this is to be expected within reason.
